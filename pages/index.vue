            The US healthcare system is designed to maximize profit, not patient
            care. Millions of working-class Americans have lost their health
            insurance during the COVID-19 pandemic; meanwhile, California's 165
            billionaires have seen their wealth increase by $175,000,000,000
            since March. In the richest state in the richest country in the
            world, this is unacceptable. We can and we must pass Medicare for
            Allâ€”and that starts here in California.

            Assembly Bill 1400 (AB1400) would create the California Guaranteed
            Health Care for All program, or CalCare, to provide comprehensive
            universal single-payer health care coverage for the benefit of all
            residents of the state. Authored by State Assembly member Ash Kalra,
            AB1400 would expand coverage to nearly 3 million uninsired
            Californians and provide rich benefits, including dental care,
            generous prescription drug coverage and long-term care.

            The Democratic Socialists of America is the largest socialist
            organization in the United States, with over 92,000 members and
            chapters in all 50 states. We believe that working people should run
            both the economy and society democratically to meet human needs, not
            to make profits for a few. We are a political and activist
            organization, not a party; through campus and community-based
            chapters, DSA members use a variety of tactics, from legislative to
            direct action, to fight for reforms that empower working people.
